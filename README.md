Overview

Using Matplotlib library to create charts and graphs with desired data.

Purpose

To use Matplotlib to create charts that are used to design desirable graphs ranging from bar charts to line graphs, scatter plots, and more.

![Ride-sharing data](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86568537/132261308-325c1b08-9e02-4e18-ba81-283c31c8a1bf.PNG)

From the result, it is obvious that the Urban city has more drivers which definitely brings in more income. The ratio of average fare per ride to average fare per driver is high in the rural city but the disadvantage is total rides.

The data extracted between dates 2019-01-01 to 2019-04-29 clearly shows the difference in rides within the three cities. Most days in the rural city there are zero rides for the day which is not profitable although their fare is high.

Summary:

The ride analysis gives an in-depth on which city is best to invest more in terms of hiring more drivers and making more money, the rural city has more fare cost but fewer rides which makes it less profitable, the suburban is moderate, the urban city is less in the fare but has the most rides and its highly profitable. It is advisable to invest more in the urban city than rural and suburban.
